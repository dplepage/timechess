Continuum Chess
---------------

This is time-travel-themed chess variant where it is not the pieces but the players who can travel through time.

In essence, you play a game of traditional chess by starting with the traditional initial board for chess, and alternating with your opponent adding new moves to the end of a list of moves; the game ends when the list of moves results in a state where one player's King is capture (or, at least, guaranteed to be captured).

This variant simply relaxes the restriction "at the end of the list of moves".

Thus, in continuum chess, you have the whole timeline of a game of chess in front of you, and you and your opponent alternate adding new moves *at any point in the game's history*.
